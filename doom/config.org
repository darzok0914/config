** Paths
=org-mode= requires to have a bunch of paths filled to create notes, tasks etc.

** Default visibility
When /emacs/ visits an ~.org~ file for the first time, the global state is set to =OVERVIEW=. It is possible to change that
behavior with the =+STARTUP:= modifier. Accepted values are:

- =STARTUP: overview=
- =STARTUP: content=
- =STARTUP: showall=
- =STARTUP: showeverything=

** Plain lists
Plain lists come into three parts:

1. Unordered lists start with =-=, =+= or =*=.
2. Ordered lists start with =1.=.
3. Description list items use the =::= delimiter.

As an example for /description lists/:

- Foo :: description goes here.
- Bar :: other description goes here.

** Drawers
Emacs has /drawers/ that allow to hide content. They are introduced with the =:DRAWERNAME:= with =:END:= syntax.
:DRAWERNAME:
This can be folded if wanted
:END:

** Hyperlinks
*** General
The general syntax is ~[[LINK][DESCRIPTION]]~, or simply ~[[LINK]]~. A link like ~[[*Something like that]]~ points to a section in the current document.
/Dedicated targets/ links look like ~<<this>>~.

It is possible to store a link to the current location with =org-store-link=
*** Link abbreviations
The syntax is ~[[linkword:tag][description]]~. They allow to inject text based on the value of ~tag~ if the abbrev list contains either ~%s~ or
~%h~.

This list defines the available linkwords:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-link-abbrev-alist
      '(("google"    . "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s")
        ("gmap" . "https://maps.google.com/maps?q=%s")
        ("gimages" . "https://google.com/images?q=%s")
        ("doom-repo" . "https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/%s")
        ("wolfram" . "https://wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%s")
        ("wikipedia" . "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s")
        ("duckduckgo" . "https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s")
        ("youtube" . "https://youtube.com/watch?v=%s")
        ("github" . "https://github.com/%s")
        ("wr" . "https://www.wordreference.com/enfr/%s")))
#+END_SRC

Special abbreviations can be set on a per-file basis with ~#+LINK: google http://www.google.com/search?q=%s~, for instance.

** Todo lists
The =TODO= annotation sets a /todo/ in any headline.

*** Workflow states
States:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WIP(w!/!)" "FROZEN(z!/!)" "LATER(l!/!)" "|" "DONE(d!/!)")
        (sequence "BUG(b)" "|" "FIXED(f!/!)")
        (sequence "FEATURE(r)" "|" "IMPLEMENTED(i!/!)")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELLED(c@)")))
#+END_SRC

Faces:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      '(("TODO" . "blue") ("WIP" . (:foreground "green" :weight bold)) ("FROZEN" . "blue") ("DONE" . "grey")
        ("BUG" . (:foreground "red" :weight bold)) ("FIXED" (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))
        ("FEATURE" . "purple") ("IMPLEMENTED" . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))
        ("CANCELLED" . "grey")))
#+END_SRC

*** Progress logging
Timestamp can be automatically added when changing a TODO state, or by doing it manually with =org-todo= with the =C-u= prefix argument —
also =SPC u= for us.

Automatically track closing time:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-log-done 'time)
#+END_SRC

Put the TODO notes into a drawer — =LOGBOOK=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-log-into-drawer t)
#+END_SRC

It is possible to set whether we want to add a timestamp or a timestamped note for each keyword with, respectively, ~!~ (for timestamp) or
~@~ (for a timestamped note). Use ~/~ to state what to do when switching back from a mode.

*** Habits
Habits are special =TODO= items used to track reccurent activities. It must:

1. Be a =TODO= item.
2. Has the =STYLE= property set to =habit=.
3. Has a scheduled date, usually with a ~.+~ style repeate interval. ~++~ stands for habits with time constraints and ~+~ for unusual habit with
   a backlog.
4. Time range can be put with ~/~ after ~.+~ — e.g. ~.+2d/4d~ for something that can be done after two days but shouldn’t take more than four.
5. The =DONE= state triggers state logging.

*** Priorities
Priorities help with sorting items with priorities.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-fancy-priorities-list '("❗" "⬆" "⬇"))
#+END_SRC

*** Subtasks
To enable subtasks, insert ~[/]~ or ~[%]~ anywhere in the headline.

Automatically change to =DONE= an entry when its children have been completed:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
  "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
  (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
    (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

(add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)
#+END_SRC

**** Example with / [1/3]
***** TODO Foo
***** DONE Bair
***** TODO Zoo

**** Example2 with % [33%]
***** TODO Foo
***** DONE Bar
***** TODO Zoo

*** Checkboxes
Checkboxes start with a ~[ ]~.

Example:
**** TODO Organize party [0/2]
- [-] call people [1/3]
  - [ ] Peter
  - [X] Sarah
  - [ ] Sam
- [-] order food
  - [ ] think about what music to play
  - [X] talk to the neighbors

** Tags
Tags have the form ~:tag:~ or ~:tag1:tag2:tag3:etc.~ and are located at the end of headlines.

Default tags:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '(("spare" . ?s) ("work" . ?w) ("learn" . ?l)))
#+END_SRC

** Properties
Properties are like tags, but key-value pairs. They use the special =:PROPERTIES: … :END:= drawer and have the syntax ~:name: value~.
The special syntax ~:+PROPERTY: var+ value~ allows to append a value to an already declared variable.

Special properties:
| Property name  | Description                                                                                                                             |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| =CLOCKSUM=     | The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree. org-clock-sum must be run first to compute the values in the current buffer.                 |

| =DEADLINE=     | The deadline timestamp.                                                                                                                 |
| =FILE=         | The filename the entry is located in.                                                                                                   |
| =ITEM=         | The headline of the entry.                                                                                                              |
| =PRIORITY=     | The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.                                                                               |
| =SCHEDULED=    | The scheduling timestamp.                                                                                                               |
| =TAGS=         | The tags defined directly in the headline.                                                                                              |
| =TIMESTAMP=    | The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.                                                                                          |
| =TIMESTAMP_IA= | The first inactive timestamp in the entry.                                                                                              |

** TODO Columns
Columns allow to have a tabular view of headlines.

**** Example
:PROPERTIES:
:COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
:END:
***** One :foo:
***** Two :bar:
***** Three :zoo:

** Timestamps
General form is ~<2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>~. They can have a repeater interval, as in ~<2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>~.
Two timestamps connected by ~--~ denote a range.  Inactive timestamps are surrounded with ~[]~.

Planning can be done with two special keywords: =DEADLINE:= and =SCHEDULED:=, right before the date.

** Moving information around
Refiling allow to move heading where the cursor is in into another heading somewhere else, with completion.
Copying is the same, but preserves the original source.

Archiving allows to move something out of the way, to prevent it from showing up again in agendas and listing. It requires setting up the
=org-archive-location= variable first. The default is enough for us though right now.

** Capturing
Capturing allows to quickly write some notes without leaving a mode / buffer. It requires a bunch of configuration to work:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/org"
      org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
#+END_SRC
** Faces
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
#+END_SRC
